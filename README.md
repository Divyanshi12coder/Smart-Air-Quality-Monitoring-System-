# Smart-air-quality-monitoring-system-
IoT based project, to track and analyze air quality in real-time, providing data on pollutants like particulate matter, gases, and other factors.
Overview

A Smart Air Quality Monitoring System is an IoT-based solution that continuously monitors air pollutants and

environmental parameters. It provides real-time data on air quality, enabling preventive measures to reduce

health risks and pollution levels.

Key Features

- Real-time monitoring of pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, CO2, CO, NO2, etc.)

- Temperature and humidity sensing

- Mobile/Web dashboard with real-time AQI visualization

- Alerts and notifications on crossing threshold values

- Historical data logs and trends analysis

- GPS-based location tagging for each device

- Solar-powered/low-energy hardware options

Project Agenda

1. Identify parameters and sensors (e.g., MQ135, DHT11, PMS5003)

2. Select microcontroller (ESP32/Arduino) and communication method (Wi-Fi/Bluetooth)

3. Connect to cloud platform for data storage and visualization

4. Build mobile/web dashboard to display AQI in real time

5. Implement alert systems (email, SMS, app notification)

6. Test system under various environmental conditions

7. Optimize for energy efficiency and deploy in test locations

Future Scope

- Integration with smart city infrastructure and government dashboards

- Predictive analytics using AI/ML for pollution forecasting

- Drone-based mobile AQI monitoring units

- Indoor and outdoor hybrid monitoring with dynamic control (e.g., smart purifiers)

- Citizen participation through crowd-sourced pollution mapping
